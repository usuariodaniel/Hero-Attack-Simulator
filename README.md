# Hero Attack Simulator

This repository contains a JavaScript class named `hero` which simulates attacks from different types of heroes. The heroes include a Wizard, Warrior, Monk, and Ninja. Each hero type has a different attack style. The `hero` class includes a constructor to initialize the hero's properties and an `attacks` method to simulate the hero's attack.

## Installation

This is a simple JavaScript class and does not require any specific installation. You can copy the `hero` class and use it in your JavaScript project.

## Usage

To use this class, create a new instance of the `hero` class with the `new` keyword, passing the name, age, and kind of the hero as arguments. Then, call the `attacks` method on the hero instance to simulate the hero's attack.

```javascript
let wizard = new hero("Gandalf", 150, "Wizard");
wizard.attacks();
```
